"""
Script that contains all the functions that can be viewed using the graph viewer UI. 
The script contains an abstract class Function that is inherited by all the 
subclasses that have the description for specific functions.
In order to add new functions to be displayed by the UI, simply create a new class
describing that function, and extend Functions class.
For each class inherting Function:
Name: Defines the name identifier used in the GUI
A, B: The changable parameters defining the function
